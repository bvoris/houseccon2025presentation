Collaborating with Infrastructure Security and Threat Intelligence teams to enhance security use cases and fine-tune alerting logic for improved detection accuracy.
Conducting proactive threat hunting, leveraging data from multiple sources to uncover hidden threats and improve our security posture.
Maintaining and refining security monitoring tools and processes to reduce false positives and increase detection effectiveness.
Participating in 24/7 on-call rotations, providing timely responses to critical incidents.
Creating and documenting playbooks and response procedures to streamline future investigations and improve response consistency.
Escalating security incidents to Senior Analyst or DFIR teams as needed for deeper analysis and remediation.
Supporting the ongoing development of DigitalOcean’s security monitoring program, ensuring alignment with evolving industry best practices and threat landscapes.

What We’ll Expect From You

2+ years of hands-on experience with SIEM platforms (e.g., Elastic SIEM, SentinelOne) and endpoint detection tools.
Strong foundational understanding of network and endpoint security, including common attack techniques and mitigation strategies.
Familiarity with operating systems like Linux, Unix, Windows, and MacOS.
Solid analytical skills with the ability to assess complex security incidents and prioritize responses based on risk.
Clear written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to document findings and effectively collaborate with cross-functional teams.
A proactive mindset, eager to expand your security skills and contribute to a strong security culture.
Basic scripting and query language skills (Python, Bash, and SQL) are a plus, along with experience in log analysis and data correlation.
Comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with a collaborative and growth-focused mindset.
Ability to quickly adapt to new security tools, technologies, and techniques.

Why You’ll Like Working For DigitalOcean

We innovate with purpose. You’ll be a part of a cutting-edge technology company with an upward trajectory, who are proud to simplify cloud and AI so builders can spend more time creating software that changes the world. As a member of the team, you will be a Shark who thinks big, bold, and scrappy, like an owner with a bias for action and a powerful sense of responsibility for customers, products, employees, and decisions. 
We prioritize career development. At DO, you’ll do the best work of your career. You will work with some of the smartest and most interesting people in the industry. We are a high-performance organization that will always challenge you to think big. Our organizational development team will provide you with resources to ensure you keep growing.
